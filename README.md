# SysImplode
## About
This is a program made to make your system implode by generating up to 4611686014132400000 random* numbers. 


*The numbers are generated by the Mersenne-Twister algorithm, which is not totally random.   
(To be fair, no random number algorithm is truly random.)


## Future Features
* Passing arguments into the program.   
* The ability to run on the GPU.   
* The ability to clog up all the RAM.
