## About

This is a program made to overload a system by generating up to an infinite amount of random numbers. All randomly generated numbers are produced with the 64-bit Mersenne Twister algorithm to ensure quality destruction of your system. The program is designed to be compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

## Current Features

- Passing command line arguments to control generation
- Generating infinite streams of random numbers  
- Compatibility with 32-bit and 64-bit architectures

## Future Development

Planned enhancements include utilizing the GPU for massively parallel number generation to maximize system load. Additional command line arguments and better error handling are also on the roadmap.

## Downloads

You can download and compile the source files from the [releases](https://github.com/wh4ky/SysImplode/releases) page.
